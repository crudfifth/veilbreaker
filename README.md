# `Veilbreaker`

## Overview
**Veilbreaker** is a research-oriented project designed to explore and analyze advanced **Directory Traversal** techniques across multiple environments. The goal is to study, document, and understand both modern and sophisticated traversal attacks while developing tools to simulate them. 

This repository is strictly for educational and cybersecurity research purposes.

## Features
- **Multi-Target Capability**  
  - Web-based directory traversal exploits (Flask, Django, Express.js, PHP)  
  - Local system traversal (Linux, Windows, WSL)  
  - Cloud & containerized environments (AWS, GCP, Kubernetes)  

- **Advanced Evasion Techniques**  
  - Unicode & double encoding  
  - Path normalization bypass  
  - Metadata API exploitation (Cloud environments)  
  - Symbolic link abuse  

- **Automated Payload Generation**  
  - Adaptive fuzzing for traversal vectors  
  - Encoding-aware payload crafting  
  - Heuristic-based response detection  

## Installation
